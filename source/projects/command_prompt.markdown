## Overview

Tell the students about the history of the command prompt. Go over why understanding the command prompt is important for programmers.


## The basic commands

Show the class how each of the command prompt commands work. It is often helpful to open up the familiar explorer window by typing `explorer .` and showing students that changes you are making in the command prompt affect what one sees in the explorer window.

`ls` = lists the current files in the current directory

`cd` = "current directory" (displays your current path)

`cd ..` = Moves up one directory

`cd <directory_name>` = moves into the named directory

`mkdir` = creates a new directory

`touch <filename>` = creates a new file

`rm <file_name>` = deletes the named file withing the directory

`rm -R <directory_name>` = deletes the named directory and all the files within it

`mv <original_file> <new_location>` = moves a file from one directory to another

`mv <original_file> <new_name>` = changes the name of a file (notice that this is the same as moving a file to another location)

`cls` = clears the command line so you have a clean window (can also be obtained with Ctrl + L)
