Variables: Strings and Integers

Variables store data and help us keep track of information. Variables can be used for different purposes and have different types. Two common types are string (text) and integer (numbers). 

When adding variables to our program we should think about the purpose for which we would want to store data in a particular program, the scenarios during which we would want to manipulate the data, the place in the program where we would want to use the data stored, etc.

Naming variables is important. Intuitive names help us understand our code. When thinking about naming our variables we should make sure we understand the purpose for the variable.

Variables are set using the equals operator (=). The value on the right side of the equals sign is the value that is stored. Once a variable is set, it will store that information until the variable is set to a new value.

Ask students to try the following in irb: 

number is a variable being used to store an integer
number = 5
puts number
number = 10
puts number

name is a variable being used to store a string
name = “CodeNow”
puts name
name = “CodeLater”
puts name
