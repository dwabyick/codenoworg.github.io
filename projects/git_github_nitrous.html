    <h2>What is Git?</h2>

<p>When you are working on an important project or a large project, you want to be able to go back to an earlier version if you need to. Many people make sure they can do this by making a copy of their project every time they are going to work on it and working on this new copy.</p>

<p>When you are working with only one file or just a few files, it is easy to do this. However, programmers work with hundreds of files, if not thousands, at a time. To help them keep track of all the changes and all the files, programmers use version control systems (VCSs).</p>

<p>Git is a type of VCS developed by the Linux development community, and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. It was first created in 2005. Although Git is mostly used for programming projects, it could be used to manage any other type of file, such as text documents.</p>

<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>

<p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service with Git functionality. In other words, it is a place where you can store your files and you access it thru the web. In addition to helping you keep track of changes you make to your files by using Git, GitHub has other features that promote collaboration such as wikis and the ability to copy other people’s projects.</p>

<p>“The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a project from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your project with the original project. These three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful.” (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/">http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/</a>)</p>

<h2>What is Nitrous.io</h2>

<p>Nitrous.io is a web-based platform that lets you create and share development environments. A development environment refers to the collection of applications and tools programmers have installed on their machines that helps them develop their applications, debug their code, and test their programs. Development environments on Nitrous.io sit on the cloud allowing you to work from any computer with Internet access, no need for a local workstation. In addition, it allows you to collaborate on a project in real-time.</p>
